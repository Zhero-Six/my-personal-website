# My Personal Website

A responsive personal website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, featuring a modern futuristic design with interactive animations and a particle background. The site includes four pages—Home, About, Work, and Contact—with a functional contact form powered by Formspree, local images, and social media links evenly spaced across a single-row footer.

## Features
- **Modern Futuristic Design**: Dark gradient theme with neon cyan (`#00ffcc`) and pink (`#ff007a`) accents, glassy effects, and sleek typography using the Roboto font.
- **Particle Background**: Dynamic, interactive particle effect using Particles.js, with neon-colored particles and lines.
- **Local Images**: Custom images from the `./images/` directory on each page, styled with hover zoom and neon effects.
- **Social Media Links**: Icons for X, Facebook, Instagram, GitHub, WhatsApp, and Email spaced across the full footer width, larger on Contact page.
- **Interactive Animations**:
  - Pulsing logo in the header.
  - Hover underlines and lift effects on navigation links.
  - Scroll-triggered fade-in for page sections.
  - Glowing text and form fields on hover/focus.
  - Dynamic button scaling and form submission feedback.
- **Pages**:
  - **Home**: A welcoming landing page with a hero section and image.
  - **About**: Personal bio with an image.
  - **Work**: Showcase of projects with an image.
  - **Contact**: Contact details, an image, and a Formspree-powered form.
